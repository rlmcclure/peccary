PECCARY (Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics) 
is a pure-python package for distinguishing between regular, complex, and stochastic
behavior in timeseries. It is based on the work by 
`Bandt & Pompe (2002) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2002PhRvL..88q4102B/abstract>`__ , 
`Rosso et al. (2007) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2007PhRvL..99o4102R/abstract>`__ , 
and `Weck et al. (2015) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015PhRvE..91b3101W/abstract>`__. 
In addition to calculating the Permutation Entropy ($H$) and Statistical Complexity
($C$) values, this package also has plotting tools for the $HC$-plane and visualizing the 
resulting $[H,C]$ values for various timeseries.

A detailed summary of the PECCARY method can be found in Hyman, Daniel, & Schaffner (in prep). 
If you make use of PECCARY, please include a citation to Hyman, Daniel, & Schaffner (in prep) 
in any publications.
