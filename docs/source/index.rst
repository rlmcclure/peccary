``peccary`` (Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics) 
is a Python package for distinguishing between regular, complex, and stochastic
behavior in timeseries. It is based on the work by 
`Bandt & Pompe <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2002PhRvL..88q4102B/abstract>`_ (2002), 
`Rosso et al. <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2007PhRvL..99o4102R/abstract>`_ (2007), 
and 
`Weck et al. <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015PhRvE..91b3101W/abstract>`_ (2015).
This code is also based on work by collaborator David Schaffner, who wrote the initial 
version of some of the method, called `PESCy <https://github.com/dschaffner/PESCy>`__.

In addition to calculating the Permutation Entropy (:math:`H`) and Statistical Complexity
(:math:`C`) values, this package also has plotting tools for the :math:`HC`-plane and 
visualizing the resulting :math:`[H,C]` values for various timeseries, examples timeseries, 
and utility functions.

A detailed summary of the PECCARY method can be found in Hyman, Daniel, & Schaffner (in prep). 
If you make use of PECCARY, please include a :ref:`citation <cite>` to 
Hyman, Daniel, & Schaffner (`arXiv:2407.11970 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11970>__`) in any publications.
